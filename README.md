# Spring AppCDS demo

This repository is intended to demonstrate how to use [Spring Framework 6.1 AppCDS support](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1-SNAPSHOT/integration/class-data-sharing.html).

## Pre-requisites

While it is possible to use Java 17, it is recommended to use Java 21 which provide a more advanced AppCDS support.
You should also use a Java distribution with a prebuilt CDS archive.

You can use [SDK manager](https://sdkman.io/) to install and use such Java disribution:
```bash
sdk env install
sdk env
```

## Build and run locally
